Easy tool for resizing an image or group of images at once.

This is a little console application. The aim of the program is to be useful and easy at simple tasks such as shrinking a image in order to keep it fit (or to reduce amount of disk space).

The application can operate with one simple image as well as with a directory containing several images.

In the near future I'm going to build a GUI for this tool.
